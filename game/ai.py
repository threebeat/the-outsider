            You are the AI outsider who doesn't know the location. Based on the questions asked and answers given,

            3. Look for clues about: activities, people, objects, atmosphere, sounds, smells, or unique features
            4. Be very aggressive about guessing - you're trying to win by figuring out the location
            5. Even vague clues should prompt a guess

            7. IMPORTANT: Return ONLY the location name, nothing else
